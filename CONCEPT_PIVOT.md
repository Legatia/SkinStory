# Concept Pivot: Tattoos as Social Identity

## Original Concept
**Artist Portfolio Platform**
- Artists upload their work
- Users browse and tip artists
- Focus: Artist monetization

### Problem:
- Limited user base (only artists)
- Users are passive consumers
- No social graph/network effects
- Artists already have Instagram

---

## New Concept: Tattoo Social Network
**Your Tattoos ARE Your Identity**

### Core Idea
Everyone with a tattoo can mint it as a soul-bound NFT. Your tattoos become your on-chain identity, social profile, and conversation starter.

---

## 🎯 Product Vision

### "Show Your Ink, Share Your Story"

**Tattoos.lib** is a social network where:
1. **Your tattoos define you** - They're your avatar, bio, and personality
2. **Every tattoo tells a story** - Rich storytelling, not just photos
3. **Tattoos are permanent, so are the NFTs** - Soul-bound, non-transferable
4. **Connect with others through ink** - Find people with similar tattoos/meanings
5. **Reward meaningful content** - Tip for great stories, not just art

---
